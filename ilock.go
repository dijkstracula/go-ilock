// Package ilock implements the following lock structure, called an "intention
// lock":
//
// Consider a concurrent tree-like data structure.  A classic example that relate
// to intention locks is a database index structure; in the example below, we are
// interested in something more approching a trie, where intermediary nodes
// represent a prefix of some larger string.  A larger system would like to have
// concurrent read and write access on strings in this trie, including the option
// of locking not just the leaves of the trie (ie. an entire string) but intermediary
// nodes in the trie (that is, all strings with a common prefix).
//
// Nodes may be locked by a reader (allowing concurrent reads) or a writer
// (mandating exclusive accsess)  If a node is locked by a particular mutator
// thread, the following invariants have to be maintained:
//
// 1)  The owning thread may access any part of the node's subtree (ie. its
// enclosing fields and/or array elements) without taking further locks in or
// otherwise traversing the subtree itself.
//
// 2)  Other threads should not be blocked from executing independent operations on
// different parts of the prefix tree.
//
// It would be trivial to implement 1) but not 2) by way of a global reader-writer
// lock on the entire tree.  The obvious extension of putting finer-grained
// reader-writer locks on each node is not sufficient, because we still need to
// ensure that taking the lock on a particular node does not violate 1) in the
// case where a descendent node is locked by a different thread.  In order to
// ensure this "hierarchial mutual exclusion", we would have to traverse the
// node's subtree (or equivalently, walk a table of held locks), which violates
// 1); or, we would have to lock each parent node as we descend, which violates
// 2).  Indeed, in our case, since our "graph of nodes" is a tree and thus has a
// single root, this would be equivalent to serializing with the global RW lock in
// the first place!
//
// We will address this by way of taking _intention locks_ as we traverse the prefix
// tree up until the current node.  This library implements such a lock.
//
// ## Overview
//
// An intention lock is similar to a reader-writer lock in that it has multiple
// states that can be set, which may or may not cause the caller to block.  These
// two states, indicating a read-only shared and read-write exclusive state
// are called, in the traditional literature, states `S` and `X`.  A node set in
// `S` or `X` _implicitly_ has all its descendent nodes set similarily; as a
// result, this won't work for arbitrary DAG or graph structures; we need exactly
// one path to a given node.
//
// There also exist provisional intention states for taking the lock as a reader
// and as as writer, called, respectively, IS and IX.
//
// `IS` is "Intention to Share": that is, it grants permission for the requesting
// thread to continue traversing the tree and set subsquent elements to IS or
// S.  The only way that a node taking IS can fail is if the current node is
// held in the X state: that is, that another thread owns that thread for write
// access.
//
// `IX` is "Intention for eXclusive access": that is, it grants permission for the
// requesting thread to continue traversing the tree and set subsequent elements
// to `IX` and `X` states, as well as any state that can be set had `IS` been set
// (though I think this is a characteristic that we don't need.)  Note that IX's
// semantics relate differently to IS as compared to `X` as compared to `S`; a
// node can be held by one thread in `IS` and also held simultaneously in `IX`.
//
// `SIX` is "Intention to Share and upgrade to IX`: our particular usecase does
// not require this state and so it is left unimplemented.
//
// Therefore, taking a shared lock on some node requires setting all ancestors to
// `IS` (blocking if necessary) and setting the node itself to `S`, and taking an
// exclusive lock on some node requires setting all ancestors to `IX` (blocking if
// necessary) and setting the node itself to `X`.
//
// The transition matrix for all states is presented below.  If a transition is
// not allowed, the caller will block.
//
//     +---------------+----------+-----------+-----------+------------+------------+
//     |Request/Holding| Unlocked | Holding X | Holding S | Holding IX | Holding IS |
//     +---------------+----------+-----------+-----------+------------+------------+
//     |Request X      |   Yes    |    No     |    No     |     No     |     No     |
//     |Request S      |   Yes    |    No     |    Yes    |     No     |     Yes    |

// Mutex implements an intention lock.  User threads will attempt to
// take the lock in one of four "state contexts", as described in the readme,
// and may end up blocking if their desired state is incompatible with the
// states already held in the lock.
//
// There are really only two interesting attributes to an ilock.Mutex: A
// condvar acts as a barrier for threads wishing to transition to a state
// incompatible with the current state context set, and then the state
// representing how many threads have entered the lock as each of its
// states. In order to check the Mutex state in a lock-free manner, the four
// fields are packed into a single uint64:
//
//     |63      48|47      32|31     16|15      0|
